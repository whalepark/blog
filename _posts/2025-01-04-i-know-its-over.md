**Confession:** I've never actually liked The Smiths. While they're a band that naturally divides opinion, given the list of British bands I enjoy, one would readily predict, using Bayesian reasoning, that I would like The Smiths. Yet, I don’t. And here’s why.

First off (and I can say this safely since Morrissey is unlikely to ever read my blog), I dislike Morrissey’s voice. I do enjoy Marr’s guitar parts, so much so that I sometimes listen to the intros of their songs and then stop before the vocals start. If The Smiths had a vocalist with a lighter, more melodic voice, I probably would’ve become a fan. That said, it's not like I seek out Marr’s solo albums but I play Morrissey's solo numbers.

Secondly, I dislike their lyrics. While others praise their lyrics, in my opinion, there is a fine line between poignant and pretentious. Overly sentimental teenage angst can be charming when delivered honestly, like in [_Boys Don’t Cry_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GkVhgIeGJQ). But The Smiths’ pretentious teenage angst feels grating. On top of that, hearing someone whine about teenage heartbreak in a voice that reminds me of a middle-aged corporate executive (someone who could easily work for a furniture or logistics company) just confuses me.

Despite my general distaste for their music, [_I Know It's Over_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6o1SEj02t0) is one rare exception. From what I read about its background (which could be wrong), Morrissey allegedly accused Marr of neglecting the band, describing their dynamic as “monogamous I, polygamous he.”. Anyway, the song feels raw and unguarded, vulnerably confessing the teenage despair. (Still, calling mother too many times is kind of turn off.)

If Morrissey happens to come across this post, I apologize. I hold no personal grudge, and if you email me (the address is in my resume), I’ll gladly take this post down.
